# Case-Study-2-Datafiniti-Electronics

### Datafiniti Electronic products data analysis using google sheets &amp; google looker studio
### This is my second portfolio project, undertaken to increase my familiarity with Google Sheets / Excel, and with the Looker Studio Viz tool

### Background Scenario
I will be using a dataset from the e-commerce platform Dataworld that focuses on electronics 
products. The data set is provided by Datafiniti via this website link. The dataset includes 
information such as product names, categories, prices, sales figures, and customer reviews. By 
leveraging this data, we can gain valuable insights into market trends, consumer preferences, and
pricing strategies. We will begin our analysis by establishing the goals & objectives of what we 
want to achieve from looking at this dataset.

### This repository contains the finished report in pdf format, as well as the cleaned spreadsheet of the data.
